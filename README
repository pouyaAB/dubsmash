# Dubsmash Challenge


# Background
DubTalk enables users to send funny Dubs to each other directly on Dubsmash. In order to show his or her feelings about a received Dub the user should be able to react to a Dub by posting emojis to it.


# Challenge
The challenge is to write a micro-service in Python that offers a simple REST interface for mobile clients and stores the information inside a TitanDB graph.

The REST interface that should be exposed should support the following operations:

* Add and remove a reaction on a Dub.
  1- A user should only be able to add one emoji as a reaction once to a single Dub
  2- but can add multiple different emojis as reactions to the same Dub.
  3- A user should be allowed to “take back” his reaction again.
  4- A user should be able to add reactions to his own Dub.
  5- Get a list of all Dubs and their reactions sorted by the date the last reaction was created.
   For every Dub the same reactions should be summed up to their total count. Example:
    If Dub A got the reactions 😀,😱,💩,😱 by random users in that order,
     the response returned by the API should be something like 😀:1, 😱:2, 💩:1
